# Trivia Dazed & Confused API


## Background

This server was created to accompany the user interface of 'Trivia Dazed & Confused', a frontend Mod 3 project at the Turing School of Software and Design. I used data from this [Trivia API](https://trivia.willfry.co.uk/) to populate a PostgreSQL database which this API querys using knex. This server was written in JavaScript using Express and Node.
